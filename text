It's difficult to provide an exact sample Bonita workflow that can be written in PowerApps because the two platforms have different design principles and functionality. However, I can provide an example scenario and the corresponding steps that can be used to create a PowerApps application that implements a similar workflow to that of Bonita.

Scenario: A company wants to create a simple approval workflow for expense reports submitted by employees.

Bonita Workflow Steps:

1. Employee submits an expense report.
2. Supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects it.
3. If approved, the expense report is sent to the finance department for processing.
4. If rejected, the expense report is sent back to the employee for revision.

PowerApps Workflow Steps:

1. Employee submits an expense report by filling out a form in a PowerApps application. The form collects information about the expense, such as the amount, date, description, and supporting documents.
2. The form is submitted to a SharePoint list, where it is stored for further processing.
3. A Power Automate flow is triggered when a new item is added to the SharePoint list. The flow sends an approval request email to the supervisor, with a link to the expense report form in the PowerApps application.
4. The supervisor reviews the expense report form and approves or rejects it by clicking a button in the PowerApps application.
5. If approved, the Power Automate flow is triggered again and sends an email notification to the finance department, requesting payment of the expense. The expense report form is also updated in the SharePoint list to reflect the approval status.
6. If rejected, the Power Automate flow sends an email notification to the employee, with comments on how to revise the expense report. The employee can then revise the form in the PowerApps application and resubmit it to the SharePoint list.

This example illustrates how a simple approval workflow can be implemented in PowerApps using SharePoint lists and Power Automate flows. While it may not be an exact replica of a Bonita workflow, it demonstrates how PowerApps can be used to implement similar business processes.

By incorporating these DevOps practices, organizations can improve the development speed, collaboration, quality, and reliability of their low-code/no-code applications. It enables teams to deliver value to end-users faster, respond to feedback and changing requirements effectively, and ensure the overall success of the application.
