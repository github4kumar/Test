**SOP Background and Instructions for Power Platform Wave Updates:**

1. **Background:**
   - Microsoft Power Platform and customer engagement apps teams release two major updates annually, in April and October, introducing new capabilities and functionalities.

2. **Early Access Option:**
   - Users may opt in for early access to these updates, available approximately two months before general availability in their region.

3. **Opt-in Process:**
   - Access Power Platform admin center and select the desired environment for update.
   - Navigate to "Updates," then "Manage," and choose "Update now" to proceed.
   - Upon completion, early access features activate for model-driven apps.

4. **Important Considerations:**
   - Updates to environments occur simultaneously and cannot be reverted after deployment.
   - It's advisable to update sandbox or trial environments before production to assess impact.
   - Ensure licensed apps receive updates; uninstalled applications remain unaffected.

5. **Update Status and Retry:**
   - Monitor update progress through the Power Platform admin center.
   - Utilize the Retry option for failed updates, available exclusively for early access updates.

6. **Confirmation and Opt-in Status:**
   - Confirm update completion by checking the deployed release wave under environment settings.

7. **Features in Early Access Updates:**
   - Early access updates include mandatory features automatically available for users.
   - Features are categorized based on user type and activation requirement.

8. **Preparing for a Release Wave:**
   - Review release plans promptly upon early access availability.
   - Create and utilize sandbox environments for testing new features to prevent irreversible deployment in production.
   - Opt in for early access updates and validate key scenarios post-update.

9. **Early Access Updates FAQ:**
   - Opt in for each early access release; environments don't auto-opt in.
   - Solutions can be exported to similarly updated environments.
   - Version numbers may not necessarily change with each release wave.
   - Microsoft doesn't provide free sandbox environments; users are responsible for their creation.
   - Updates availability for testing in sandbox environments corresponds with early access availability.

10. **Post-Update Actions:**
   - Report any issues with updates by creating a support ticket.
   - Skipping or postponing updates isn't permissible to ensure timely adoption of new features.
   - Environments with early access updates continue receiving updates throughout the release wave.
   - Environments without early access updates are automatically updated once a release wave is generally available.

By adhering to these procedures and guidelines, users can effectively manage and leverage the updates offered by the Power Platform and ensure a smooth transition to new functionalities.

Steps to copy an environment:

1. Access the Power Platform admin center and sign in with Environment Admin or System Administrator credentials.
2. Navigate to Environments from the left-side menu and choose the environment to copy.
3. Click on Copy from the top menu bar.
4. Choose the desired copy level: Everything or Customizations and schemas only.
5. Select the target environment, ensuring it's not a production environment and is within the same tenant and region.
6. Edit details for the copied environment if necessary and confirm the copy operation.
7. Review the copied environment's status once the copy process is complete.

Steps to include audit logs (if needed):

1. Follow steps 1-5 as above.
2. Under Audit logs, click to include audit logs.
3. Enable copying audit logs and continue with steps 6-9.

Next steps after copying an environment:

1. Newly created copy environment is placed in administration mode.
2. Background operations are disabled in the copy environment.
3. Review and potentially disable or redirect application components with external connections, such as Email, SharePoint, and Yammer.
4. Consider disabling or reviewing platform extensibility components like server-side plug-ins, client-side JavaScript, and flows.
5. Review connection references and custom connectors as needed.

Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Steps:

1. Update Application:
   - During inactive development periods, DevOps applies PowerPlatform Wave Update in the sandbox environment.

2. Validation:
   - Dev and DevOps teams validate the update for potential issues.

3. Bug-free Confirmation:
   - If no bugs are identified, the environment is considered frozen.

4. Update Propagation:
   - DevOps applies wave updates across all tiers: Development, Test, Stage, and Production environments.

====

Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Steps:

1. Initiation:
   - Despite ongoing development cycles, DevOps applies PowerPlatform Wave Update in the sandbox environment.

2. Validation:
   - Dev and DevOps teams validate post-update for system integrity.

3. Bug Identification:
   - Identified bugs prompt the dev team to request a new environment from DevOps.

4. New Environment Setup:
   - DevOps collaborates with CIT to establish a new environment, applying necessary updates.

5. Bug Reproduction:
   - Dev team reproduces bugs in the new environment.

6. Bug Resolution:
   - Upon reproduction, dev team resolves errors.

7. Off-cycle Release:
   - Changes are off-cycle released to test, stage, and prod environments to minimize disruption.
