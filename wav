**SOP Background and Instructions for Power Platform Wave Updates:**

1. **Background:**
   - Microsoft Power Platform and customer engagement apps teams release two major updates annually, in April and October, introducing new capabilities and functionalities.

2. **Early Access Option:**
   - Users may opt in for early access to these updates, available approximately two months before general availability in their region.

3. **Opt-in Process:**
   - Access Power Platform admin center and select the desired environment for update.
   - Navigate to "Updates," then "Manage," and choose "Update now" to proceed.
   - Upon completion, early access features activate for model-driven apps.

4. **Important Considerations:**
   - Updates to environments occur simultaneously and cannot be reverted after deployment.
   - It's advisable to update sandbox or trial environments before production to assess impact.
   - Ensure licensed apps receive updates; uninstalled applications remain unaffected.

5. **Update Status and Retry:**
   - Monitor update progress through the Power Platform admin center.
   - Utilize the Retry option for failed updates, available exclusively for early access updates.

6. **Confirmation and Opt-in Status:**
   - Confirm update completion by checking the deployed release wave under environment settings.

7. **Features in Early Access Updates:**
   - Early access updates include mandatory features automatically available for users.
   - Features are categorized based on user type and activation requirement.

8. **Preparing for a Release Wave:**
   - Review release plans promptly upon early access availability.
   - Create and utilize sandbox environments for testing new features to prevent irreversible deployment in production.
   - Opt in for early access updates and validate key scenarios post-update.

9. **Early Access Updates FAQ:**
   - Opt in for each early access release; environments don't auto-opt in.
   - Solutions can be exported to similarly updated environments.
   - Version numbers may not necessarily change with each release wave.
   - Microsoft doesn't provide free sandbox environments; users are responsible for their creation.
   - Updates availability for testing in sandbox environments corresponds with early access availability.

10. **Post-Update Actions:**
   - Report any issues with updates by creating a support ticket.
   - Skipping or postponing updates isn't permissible to ensure timely adoption of new features.
   - Environments with early access updates continue receiving updates throughout the release wave.
   - Environments without early access updates are automatically updated once a release wave is generally available.

By adhering to these procedures and guidelines, users can effectively manage and leverage the updates offered by the Power Platform and ensure a smooth transition to new functionalities.
